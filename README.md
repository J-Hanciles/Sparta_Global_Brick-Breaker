My Week 4 JavaScript Game Project - Brick-Breaker
The JavaScript Game project I came up with was quite the "spur of the moment" idea, after seeing E24's games, particularly the frequency of "Brick Breaker" models, I wanted to take the title of the game and completely switch up the play type as a joke.
A simple game, break the bricks before they break you.
