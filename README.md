# Sparta_Global_Game-Project
CONNECT-4!
- Welcome to my week 4 - Game Project

-- Objective
Within a week, I was tasked with creating a browser game, making full use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

-- Progression Log

-My initial game project idea was to create an interesting twist on the "Brick-Breaker" game model, so instead of having a paddle bouncing a ball trying to break an arrangement of bricks, bricks would fly towards a player and on key-functions the player would try to break said bricks as they flew towards 'you'.

-The planning/design phase was relatively streamlined, but converting that into a playable game using JavaScript with my current skillset proved to be an unbeatable obstacle.

-After managing to create just one array (to simulate the movement of the brick), trying to create the instance where pressing a button would restart the looping movement of the brick. I then became aware that only would I have needed to not only implement collision detection, but making of html canvas would have made this project more streamlined, given how much time I had to work with, I decided to abandon this game and move forward with another.

-Connect4 was my plan-b (after looking at creating some "gameboards" using html + css),
making use of jQuery in creating the gameboard,
removed my need to utilise arrays for each piece placement (especially after my run in during the other game's creation).

-Using jQuery as much as I did was certainly a challenge, but it was welcomed just due to how much I was able to gradually understand, there is still a learning curve for me to fully grasp the rules and functionality.

-- FUNCTION
Connect four of your pieces in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same. Press "Restart" button to empty the board.

-- Issues

Game-1 "Brick-Breaker"
- Learning to properly scale ideas to what is feasible.
- Making sure to understand which tools would best suit a game-build.
- Transparency.

Game-2 "Connect 4"
- Furthering knowledge in jQuery particularly with statements regarding data not in an array.
- Including sounds and possible animations.
- Main menu screen and game over screen.
